A virtual environment in Python is an isolated, self-contained directory that holds a specific Python interpreter and its own set of installed packages and libraries. It provides a way to manage dependencies for different Python projects independently, preventing conflicts between projects that might require different versions of the same package

matlab ki


virtualenv allow karta hai aapko different packages ke version ko download me karne me 


jaisy: agr hmmare pass panda library ka ver 1.5 hai aur somehow we need the 2.2 version to agar hum download krengy 2.2 ko to 1.5 hat jayega 

yaha virtualenv ek copy bana deta hai file ki jaha aap dusre version ko safely use kar saklty hai
